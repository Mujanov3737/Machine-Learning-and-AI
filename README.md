# Machine Learning
Artificial intelligence and the resulting applications emerging from the training of machine learning models are quite exciting. With ChatGPT being regarded as one of the fastest growing consumer applications ever, it is no wonder that AI will play a large role in the future of many facets of society, but particularly in the tech industry.
Contained within this repository is a few scripts utilizing the Keras API and the TensorFlow platform to explore the applications and innerworkings of machine learning. a number of simple machine learning applications were studied, such as models that can identify hand-written digits, simulate balancing a pole on a track, and navigate a maze efficiently to find a particular objective while avoiding hazards. The latter model is what is contained within this repository. Also covered were the many ethical and societal implications AI content may bring with it.
### Deep Q-Learning Model
The basic premise of the application in this repository is as follows: there is a player who must navigate a tile-based maze, avoid hazards, and ultimately reach a treasure chest to complete the game. Meanwhile, a non-playable antagonist in the form of a pirate is also attempting to reach the treasure before the player. This repository contains a few python scripts and a Jupyter notebook that outlines the deep Q-learning algorithm and reinforcement learning principles used to train the pirate character to efficiently navigate the maze and defeat the player, with the help of the Keras library.
### AI in Computer Science
On a more general note, machine learning and AI is quite a complicated field where developers and other professionals must come up with models and algorithms so that tasks can be performed without the traditional types of programming of input => output. While some problems are well suited for traditional programming, others contain a high level of complexity that can only realistically be achieved using machine learning, such as identifying a human hand from various positions, races, and angles. Though that may be a trivial example, other more serious applications involve real world problems such as predicting the three-dimensional structure of a protein based on its amino acid profile, which OpenAIâ€™s AlphaFold has made significant strides toward using deep learning techniques.
The significant challenge facing these types of organizations and developers is the plethora of ethical implications in AI products. These range from the privacy and security implications of data collection from users in order to train models to perform particular functions, to the transparency in how AI applications generate the data they generate, to even the potential impact AI may have in the future on jobs, businesses, or society at large.
